The server is written in JS and will savely contain all api keys and send all requests to the external apis.

The client is written in TypeScript to learn and enhance my knowledge on this topic.
Also I tried to create a Single Page Application and use Lazy loading to enhance the performance if the client.

## Additional Information:
